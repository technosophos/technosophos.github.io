After letting my old Technosophos site languish for a decade, I decided to start afresh.

For many years I ran a site called technosophos.com that had tips and tricks that I had learned along my engineering journey. I stopped updating the blog soon after Microsoft acquired Deis. When I left Microsoft to start Fermyon, I did most of my blogging on Fermyon itself.

While porting content off of an old AWS account, I decided it was high time that I update the blog as well. So I am getting a clean start.
